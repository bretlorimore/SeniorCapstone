// Jake, this fixes the issue you were seeing where when width was set to 100%
// you were getting a 0 value - this is because the code was executing before that
// svg element was actually rendered/had a width associated with it. This jQuery function
// below, $(document).ready takes a function as an argument and calls it when the document
// is ready, i.e. when that svg has a width associated with it.
//
// Also, it is better practice call your init methods from within your js file than from
// within your HTML, that is why I commented out this call in the HTML file.
$(document).ready(initSim);


// I think now is a good time to start working the view as a "class". This is because the
// view should have some properties associated with it, like the sun/moon objects. Also
// this results in ultimately cleaner code. JavaScript "classes" are actually functions.
// Here we define the View "class". Instances of it can be instantiated like this:
//
//  var view = new View();
//
function View()
{
    // $('#cont') is jQuery shorthand for document.getElementById("cont")
    // but returns an array - that is why we call get(0) on it, this is the same
    // as $('#cont')[0]
    this.window = $('#cont').get(0);
    this.sun    = $('#sun').get(0);
    this.moon   = $('#moon').get(0);
}

//
//  var view = new View();
//  view.init();
//

    //
    //  var w = view.get_window_size().width
