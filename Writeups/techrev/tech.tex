\section{Eclipse Image Processor}

The eclipse image processor is the piece of our project that handles the spatial
and temporal alignment of the eclipse images that are uploaded to the Eclipse
Megamovie website. We have identified three pieces\cite{imgKrista} into which
the image processor can be broken down. These are: image classification and
manipulation, the runtime environment, and circle detection. In order for this
element of our project to operate effectively it is critical that these three
pieces utilize robust and functional technologies. This section of the
technology review details what options are available for implementing each of
these three pieces, analyzes these options, and arrives at a determination as to
which option is the best in the context of this project.
