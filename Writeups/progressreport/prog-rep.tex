\section{Project Overview}

The North American Solar Eclipse 2017 Senior Capstone project is partnership
with Google to build a set of applications that will assist the development of
the Eclipse Megamovie Project. The overall project has been broken down into
three components: the eclipse image processor, the image processor manager, and
the solar eclipse simulator. Each will be individually outlined in the sections
below.

\subsection{Image Processor}

The image processorâ€™s primary activity is to quickly and consistently identify
images of an eclipse at totality. The Eclipse Megamovie project will be
collecting thousands of images from photographers around the country, and the
image processor needs to identify the images of the eclipse at totality so that
these can then be stitched into a timelapse movie. In order to make the
stitching as easy as possible for the Eclipse Megamovie team, the image
processor will add metadata to each processed image that includes spatial
information about where the image was taken along the path of totality and
temporal information about how far into totality the eclipse is.


The purpose of the Image Processor is not to process many images as quickly as
possible. Instead, our goal is to be able to consistently and accurately process
a single image at a time. As such, the image processor will fit into the larger
project as an executable file that is called by the Image Processor Manager.
This allows us to focus the image processor solely on a single goal, and leave
parallelization and deployment to a different piece of the project.

\subsection{Image Processor Manager}

The image processor manager will be a Python application responsible for managing the image processor
application. This includes collecting images from Google Cloud for the image processor to process, 
invoking the image processor with these images as input, and collecting the output of the image 
processor and uploading it to Google Cloud. The image processor and image processor manager will be 
deployed together in a single docker container to Google Container Engine Clusters (of VMs). \\

An important role of the image processor manager is that it will be responsible for ensuring that 
the compute resources on the host VMs are as saturated as possible. This means invoking multiple 
image processor processes concurrently, while at the same time downloading the next images to be 
processed and uploading the already processed images. The image processor manager will achieve 
this parallelism through process based concurrency in Python, as in Python, thread based concurrency 
is throttled by the global interpreter lock (GIL). We chose to use Python for this application as it 
will be much simpler to write in Python and we can sidestep any concurrency issues by using process 
based parallelism as mentioned above. \\

\section{Current Status of the Project}

As a whole this project has moved from the pre-planning stages into the earliest
development phase. The image processor and the image processor manager are both
fully designed, while the eclipse simulator is farther along and has some existing proof of
concept code.

\subsection{Image Processor}

This part of the project is still in the design and planning phase, development
work has not begun. However, we have a clear design plan and have identified
several tools and technologies that we will use to build the image processor.

The image processor will use OpenCV and its built in Hough Transform as well as
an existing algorithm that we plan to modify and improve upon in order to
identify eclipses in images. We have chosen to use C++ to build the image
processor because it gives us better control over the speed at which this
application runs while still providing us with the ability to leverage the
OpenCV API. We have also clearly defined the inputs and outputs of the in order
to allow the parts of the system that interact with the image processor to
proceed independently with their development.

\subsection{Image Processor Manager}

Development has yet to start on the image processor manager, but we have a very good idea of how we 
are going to build it. Additionally, we will have access to code that Bret wrote during his internship 
this summer that we will be able to repurpose to handle large parts of the interactions with Google Cloud.
