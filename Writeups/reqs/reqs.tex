\begin{abstract}

On August 21, 2017 a total solar eclipse will pass over the United States. The
path of totality will stretch from Oregon to South Carolina. There has not been
a total solar eclipse like this, crossing the country from coast to coast, since
the eclipse of 1918. The Eclipse Megamovie Project is a collaboration between
Google and scientists from UC Berkeley and several other institutions with the
aim of compiling a large dataset of eclipse observations. Acquiring coronal data
is of particular interest as the corona is not normally visible from Earth.
Specifically, the project will crowdsource photos of the eclipse from
photographers at various locations along the path of totality. These images will
be aligned spatially and temporally and stitched into a unique movie that shows
the eclipse over a period of 1.5 hours as it passes across the United States.
Additionally, the complete photo dataset will be open sourced so that
independent researchers may do their own analysis.

Google will contribute applications providing, among other things, backend image
processing, photo upload capabilities, and static informational content. This
senior capstone project will consist of three distinct sub-projects, specifically,
implementing/modifying an image processing algorithm facilitating the
classification and alignment of solar eclipse images before they are stitched into
a movie, a developer pipeline, and a location-based eclipse simulator.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this software requirements specification (SRS) is to describe in
detail the Eclipse Image Processor, Eclipse Image Processor Developer Pipeline,
and the Eclipse Simulator that our group will
produce. By writing these requirements down and agreeing to them with our
sponsor both parties will have a clear understanding of what the finished
product will be and what it will be able to do. The intended audience for this
SRS is our sponsor, the Senior Capstone Instruction Team, and ourselves.

\subsection{Scope}
We are producing three products: an Eclipse Image Processor, an Eclipse
Image Processor Developer Pipeline, and an Eclipse
Simulator. The Eclipse Image Processor will ingest images and identify the sun
and moon.
The Eclipse Image Developer Pipeline
will download images to be processed by the image processor, build and run the
image processor on these images, generate an HTML document with the results,
and upload the processed images and HTML document to Google Cloud Storage. The Eclipse
Simulator will provide users with a 2D visual representation of the eclipse from a
specified location within a 3 hour time range.

\subsection{Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations}

	\textbf{Eclipse Megamovie Project:}

	and scientists from Berkeley and several other institutions with the
	aim of collecting large quantities of observations of the solar eclipse
	that will pass over the United States on August 21, 2017. The project
	will crowdsource photos of the eclipse from photographers at various
	points along the path of totality. \\

	\noindent \textbf{JPEG/JPG:}
	JPEG is a lossy compression technique for images. When we refer
	to JPEG/JPG files in this document we are referring to image files
	compressed in this method with the .jpeg or .jpg file extension. \\

	\noindent \textbf{PNG:}
	PNG refers to the Portable Network Graphics image file format.
	Images in the PNG format are frequently referred to as "PNGs" and are
	saved with the .png file extension.


\subsection{References}

This SRS makes reference to a report by Larisza D. Krista and Scott W.
McIntosh titled "The Standardisation and Sequencing of Solar Eclipse Images for
the Eclipse Megamovie Project." This technical report was produced as a
collaboration between scientists at the University of Colorado at Boulder, the
National Center for Atmospheric Research and the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration. This paper can be found on arxiv.org.

\subsection{Overview}

The remainder of this SRS contains an overall description of the Eclipse Image
Processor, Eclipse Image Processor Developer Pipeline, and Eclipse Simulator
systems in section 2. Following these descriptions are specific requirements
for the systems in section 3.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%  SECTION 2: OVERALL DESCRIPTION
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\section{Overall Description}
\subsection{Product perspective}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item These products, the Eclipse Image Processor, Eclipse Image
		Processor Developer Pipeline, and the Eclipse Simulator, are all components of
		the larger Eclipse Megamovie Project. The Eclipse Image Processor will be
		a binary that processes images, finds the sun and moon in each image, and
        exports metdata about the images. The Eclipse Image Processor Developer
        Pipeline is an interface that allows easy experimentation and development
        with the image processor via a test script that builds and runs the processor, can
        download images, and uploads an HTML document to Google Cloud Storage
        with nicely formatted output. The Eclipse Simulator will be a standalone
        JavaScript module that can be added to an existing webpage.

		\item The Eclipse Image Processor and Image Processor Developer Pipeline
		do not directly interface with the user, the pipeline will function as a
        developer tool and the Image Processor will eventually function as a backend
        system for file uploads on the Eclipse Megamovie website.
		The Eclipse Simulator does interface
		directly with the user. It should function on most modern
		internet browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). The simulator
		will appear to the user as a 2D animated depiction of the
		Sun and the Moon as they appear at the specified time and
		location. The simulator will also have background imagery in
		addition to the Sun and the Moon. Besides the images, the
		simulator will have a time slider, a location input, a zoom feature,
        and a play button.

		\item This system does not interface with hardware.

		\item The Eclipse Image Processor and Image Processor Developer Pipeline
		will be designed to run on Ubuntu 16.04. It is necessary for these
		applications to be compatible with this operating system because
		the machines that will be running the them also run Ubuntu 16.04. The Eclipse
		Simulator is a JavaScript module that will work on modern
		browsers like Chrome, Firefox and Safari. We expect our
		users will use these popular browsers so it is necessary
		for our product to interface with them.
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Product functions}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The Eclipse Simulator will be a standalone JavaScript
		module enabling users to "preview" the eclipse. It will be
		designed in a stylized, 2D manner. The simulator will
		incorporate a time slider that allows users to simulate the
		eclipse in a time window spanning from about 1.5 hours before maximum
        eclipse to about 1.5 hours. As users drag the time
		slider, the eclipse will animate in the simulator window.
		The view of the eclipse which users are presented will be
		specific to the selected location.

		\item The Eclipse Image Processor application will ingest eclipse
		photos and find the sun and moon in these images. In addition to
        identifying circles in the images the image processor will export
        data about its run to an output directory. This function will allow
        developers to imporove upon the application as it matures.

		\item The Eclipse Image Processor Developer Pipeline will enable easy
        experimentation and testing of the image processor. This includes
		collecting images from Google Cloud Storage for the Image Processor to process,
		invoking the Image Processor with these images as input, and collecting
		the output of the Image Processor and uploading it in a nicely formatted
        HTML document to Google Cloud Storage.

	\end{enumerate}

\subsection{User characteristics}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The Eclipse Image Processor application will be used by
            the members of this project.

		\item The Eclipse Image Processor Developer Pipeline application will be
            used by Google Engineers.

		\item The Eclipse Simulator application will be used by the
			general public. No unusual technical/scientific knowledge is
			expected of these users. It is assumed however, that these users
			are familiar with the internet and web browsers.
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Constraints}
None.

\subsection{Assumptions and dependencies}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item This SRS assumes the availability of Ubuntu 16.04.

		\item This SRS assumes the availability of Google Cloud Platform
		n1-standard-4 virtual machines.

		\item This SRS assumes the availability of the OpenCV computer
		vision library.
	\end{enumerate}

		\item The image processor will be implemented as a class that will be easily
        inheritable / modifiable by developers.

        \item The image processor will feature two modes, ''window'' and ''batch''. In window
        mode, after an image is processed, windows will open showing the original image,
        processed image, and intermediate images. In batch mode, all images will be processed
        sequentially without opening any windows. Processed images and metadata will be exported
        as described in \textit{External Interfaces: Eclipse Image Processor}.

        \item The image processor will identify the circles of the sun/moon in the images it processes.

        \item The image processor will record the number of seconds (wall clock time) needed to
        complete various portions of each image's processing.

	\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Eclipse Image Processor Developer Pipeline}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The developer pipeline will be able to download images from Google Cloud Storage, if requested.

        \item The developer pipeline will build and invoke the image processor on the requested images
        using batch mode.

        \item The developer pipeline will assemble the results of running the image processor into
        and HTML file. This HTML file, along with the processed images it references,
        will be uploaded to Google Cloud Storage to a public URL.

        \item The HTML file created by the developer pipeline will summarize the data included
        in the metadata.txt file exported by the image processor.

	\end{enumerate}
