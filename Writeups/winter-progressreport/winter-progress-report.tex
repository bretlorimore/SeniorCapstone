\section{Project Overview}

The North American Solar Eclipse 2017 Senior Capstone project is partnership
with Google to build a set of applications that will assist the development of
the Eclipse Megamovie Project. The overall project has been broken down into
three components: the eclipse image processor, the image processor manager, and
the solar eclipse simulator. Each will be individually outlined in the sections
below.

\subsection{Image Processor}

The image processor’s primary activity is to quickly and consistently identify
images of an eclipse at totality. The Eclipse Megamovie project will be
collecting thousands of images from photographers around the country, and the
image processor needs to identify the images of the eclipse at totality so that
these can then be stitched into a timelapse movie. In order to make the
stitching as easy as possible for the Eclipse Megamovie team, the image
processor will add metadata to each processed image that includes spatial
information about where the image was taken along the path of totality and
temporal information about how far into totality the eclipse is.


The purpose of the Image Processor is not to process many images as quickly as
possible. Instead, our goal is to be able to consistently and accurately process
a single image at a time. As such, the image processor will fit into the larger
project as an executable file that is called by the Image Processor Manager.
This allows us to focus the image processor solely on a single goal, and leave
parallelization and deployment to a different piece of the project.

\subsection{Image Processor Manager}

The image processor manager will be a Python application responsible for managing the image processor
application. This includes collecting images from Google Cloud for the image processor to process,
invoking the image processor with these images as input, and collecting the output of the image
processor and uploading it to Google Cloud. The image processor and image processor manager will be
deployed together in a single docker container to Google Container Engine Clusters (of VMs). \\

An important role of the image processor manager is that it will be responsible for ensuring that
the compute resources on the host VMs are as saturated as possible. This means invoking multiple
image processor processes concurrently, while at the same time downloading the next images to be
processed and uploading the already processed images. The image processor manager will achieve
this parallelism through process based concurrency in Python, as in Python, thread based concurrency
is throttled by the global interpreter lock (GIL). We chose to use Python for this application as it
will be much simpler to write in Python and we can sidestep any concurrency issues by using process
based parallelism as mentioned above. \\

\subsection{Eclipse Simulator}

The eclipse simulator will be an independent JavaScript module that can easily
be added to the existing Eclipse Megamovie webpage. This simulator will allow
users to “preview” the eclipse. It will be a 2D depiction of what the solar
eclipse in 2017 could look like given a certain location. Users will be able
to interact with a time slider that will simulate the eclipse in a time
window spanning from 12 hours before the eclipse to 12 hours after it.

To help with the eclipse ephemeris computations, we will be using an external
JavaScript library called Ephemeris. For the front end view for the simulator,
we will be utilizing HTML5 SVG. We plan to implement a model-view-controller
architecture for controlling the states of each component as well as handling
the interactions. This architecture was chosen due to the ability to easily
exchange a component without altering the whole design of the system. For
example, if one wanted to create a whole new front end for the simulator,
they would not need to rewrite the model or controller component of the system.
They would simply need to ensure that the new view component can handle the
interactions with the controller module.

%   Current Status     %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Current Status of the Project}

%As a whole this project has moved from the pre-planning stages into the earliest
%development phase. The image processor and the image processor manager are both
%fully designed, while the eclipse simulator is farther along and has some existing proof of
%concept code.

\subsection{Image Processor}

%This part of the project is still in the design and planning phase, development
%work has not begun. However, we have a clear design plan and have identified
%several tools and technologies that we will use to build the image processor.

%The image processor will use OpenCV and its built in Hough Transform as well as
%an existing algorithm that we plan to modify and improve upon in order to
%identify eclipses in images. We have chosen to use C++ to build the image
%processor because it gives us better control over the speed at which this
%application runs while still providing us with the ability to leverage the
%OpenCV API. We have also clearly defined the inputs and outputs of the in order
%to allow the parts of the system that interact with the image processor to
%proceed independently with their development.

\subsection{Image Processor Manager}

%Development has yet to start on the image processor manager, but we have a very good idea of how we
%are going to build it. Additionally, we will have access to code that Bret wrote during his internship
%this summer that we will be able to repurpose to handle large parts of the interactions with Google Cloud.

\subsection{Eclipse Simulator}

%As it currently stands, progress has been made to create an initial working
%demo of the simulator. We have worked with the Ephemeris library to see how
%accurate its computations are. There was some variance when comparing the
%values it returned to other 2017 solar eclipse predictions, but we have
%decided that the variance is not large enough to warrant worry. Work has
%been done to create a front end view for the simulator. Eventually Google
%will be providing the sprites that the simulator will use, but we are currently
%just using simple SVG circles to simulate the Sun and Moon. We also have the
%code to render these Sun and Moon SVGs on the eclipse simulator window given
%their altitude and azimuth (vertical/horizontal angular coordinates). We will
%continue working on the eclipse simulator over winter break.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%   Problems           %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Problems and Possible Solutions}

%Around week 8 of the term, we found that some results differed in the Ephemeris
%library calculations and eclipse predictions we found elsewhere. We brought
%this issue up with our client, and he said to continue progress on the
%simulator as the variance we were seeing was not very significant for the
%simulator. Once further progress has been made on the simulator, it may be
%necessary to dig into the Ephemeris codebase to determine any problems.

\section{Interesting Code}

Below are some interesting sections of the Eclipse Simulator view code that we have so far.
The code shown below focuses on rendering the Sun and Moon on the screen given their
altitude and azimuth. \\

// EclipseSimulator namespace
var EclipseSimulator = {

   // [...]

    {
        this.window   = $('#container').get(0);
        this.controls = $('#controls').get(0);
        this.sun      = $('#sun').get(0);
        this.moon     = $('#moon').get(0);

      // temp radius values
        this.sunpos  = {x: 50, y: 50, r: 2 * Math.PI / 180};
        this.moonpos = {x: 25, y: 25, r: 2 * Math.PI / 180};

        // Field of view in radians
        this.fov = {x: 80 * Math.PI / 180, y: 80 * Math.PI / 180};

        // Center of frame in radians

    },

    // Convert a to be on domain [0, 2pi)
    normalize_rad: function(a)
    {
        var pi2 = Math.PI * 2;
        return a - (pi2 * Math.floor(a / pi2));
    },

    // Compute positive distance in radians between two angles
    rad_diff: function(a1, a2)
    {
        a1 = EclipseSimulator.normalize_rad(a1);
        a2 = EclipseSimulator.normalize_rad(a2);

        var diff = a1 > a2 ? (a1 - a2) : (a2 - a1);

        return diff > Math.PI ? (2 * Math.PI) - diff : diff;

        b = 0;

        return a > b && a <= Math.PI;

EclipseSimulator.View.prototype.get_x_percent_from_az = function(az, radius)
{
    var dist_from_center = Math.sin(az - this.az_center);
    var half_fov_width   = Math.sin(this.fov.x / 2);

    if (this.az_out_of_view(az, radius))
    {
        // Just move the body way way off screen
        dist_from_center += this.fov.x * 10;
    }

    return 50 + (50 * dist_from_center / half_fov_width);
}

// This may need some re-visiting... the current computations imply a field of
// view of 2*fov.y
// Compute y coordinate in simulator window as a percentage of the window
// height
// Assumes altitude is <= (pi/2)
EclipseSimulator.View.prototype.get_y_percent_from_alt = function(alt)
{
    var height     = Math.sin(alt);
    var fov_height = Math.sin(this.fov.y);

    return 100 * height / fov_height;
}

EclipseSimulator.View.prototype.az_out_of_view = function(az, radius)
{
    var bound = this.az_center + (this.fov.x / 2);
    var dist  = EclipseSimulator.rad_diff(bound, az);
    // Body off screen to the right
    if (EclipseSimulator.rad_gt(az, bound) && dist > radius)
    {
        return true;

\section{Week by Week Summary of Group Activities}

\subsection{Winter Break Week 1}

    \begin{itemize}

    \item Tuned basic simulator UI (non-functional).

	\item Began implementing simulator model using ephemeris JS to perform sun/moon
		  position computations. Verified that these computations can be done
		  quickly enough for our purposes.

	\item Built loading screen with simple toggle function. Therefore it requires only
		  one line of code to toggle simulator loading state.

    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Winter Break Week 2}

    \begin{itemize}

    \item Built controller to link simulator model and view.

	\item Made simulator UI "prettier." Added hills to scene.

    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Winter Break Week 3}

    \begin{itemize}

    \item Built reverse geocoding proof of concept using Google Maps.

    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Winter Break Week 4}

    \begin{itemize}

    \item Connected reverse geocoding code to simulator, enabling users to use a search
	      bar to set the simulator to the location of their choice.

    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Week 1}

    \begin{itemize}

	\item Talked to our sponsor about open-sourcing the existing image processor /
		  image processor manager code. He is working on creating an external repo with
		  this code so that we can all (him included) collaborate on it there.

	\item Completed documenting requirements changes from the end of fall term. Got
		  revised requirements document signed by our sponsor.

	\item Implemented basic 2d interpolation code in Python using scipy to see if we
		  would be able to interpolate pre-computed eclipse time values from Nasa.
		  This code did not work for locations off the path of totality.

    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Week 2}

    \begin{itemize}

    \item Achieved very good (within 1 minute accuracy) results computing eclipse time
		  using 2d interpolation with scipy. This accuracy extends across the United
		  States, both inside and outside the path of totality, including in areas that
		  were previously causing problems, like Florida.

	\item Told our sponsor that this is our big development term, so we are hoping to get
		  working on the image processor / image processor manager components of our
		  project as soon as possible. He is planning to open source these as soon as
		  possible.

    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Week 3}

    \begin{itemize}

    \item Altered view rendering of Sun/Moon y position in frame.

	\item Implemented simulator zoom mode.

	\item Met with our sponsor, the Google lead on the Eclipse Megamovie project,
		  Justin Koh, and Gonglue Jiang, a Google UX designer regarding simulator design/
		  feedback.

	\item Updated zoom mode to center Sun in frame following feedback from Justin.

	\item Verified that the reason the simulator looks inaccurate in locations like San
		  Diego (where there is only a partial eclipse) is inaccurate ephemeris JS
		  computations.

	\item Considered/brainstormed various methods for improving ephemeris computations.

    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Week 4}

    \begin{itemize}

    \item Received Gonglue's design mocks from our sponsor.

	\item Proposed solutions to problems raised by the design mocks. See below:

		\begin{itemize}

		\item The hills are quite tall, if left as-is, the sun/moon will not become
			  visible until they are at a non-negligible altitude. To solve this,
			  I proposed define 0 degrees of altitude at a point towards the top of the
			  hills. This would mean that the bottom of the hills correspond to an altitude
			  value of less than 0. This should not cause any problems.

		\item The sun/moon in the mocks are very large, much more so than in the current
			  simulator, at least in wide mode. If left as-is, this will make the simulator
			  show the eclipse starting much earlier than it is supposed to. To solve this, I
			  proposed that we "stretch" degrees at the altitudes around the sun. This would
			  potentially enable us to still have a field of view where there are 80 degrees
			  of altitude, but maintain a large sun/moon. See an illustration of this concept below:

			  \begin{center}
			  	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{angle.eps}
			  \end{center}

		\end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}
