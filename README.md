# Eclipse Megamovie Senior Capstone Project

This is the repository for the Eclipse Megamovie senior capstone project at Oregon 
State University. This project is focused on making several contributions 
to the larger Eclipse Megamovie project, run by the Google Making & Science team 
and scientists at UC Berkeley. These contributions are focused on two components 
of the Eclipse Megamovie project. The first of these is a web based eclipse simulator, 
which we built from scratch. The second is an eclipse image processor, which will run 
in Google Compute Engine. The image processor was built by adding to/modifying existing 
code that was open sourced by Google. This modified image processor code is available 
at https://github.com/lariszakrista/EMP.

**Group Members:** George Harder, Bret Lorimore, Jacob Fenger
